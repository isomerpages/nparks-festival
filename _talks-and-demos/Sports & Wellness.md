* **Forest Therapy by Chew Ting Ching**

It becomes an increasingly important way to get people outside, so their bodies can access essential stimuli like sunlight, fresh air, and beneficial organic compounds released by plants. Ting Ching will also share the benefits of a guided Forest Therapy walk and how it can mend the damaged relationships humans have with themselves and communities, forming deeper and more meaningful experiences.
