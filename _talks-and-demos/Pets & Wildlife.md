##### Talks
<br>

* **An Introduction to Terrestrial Arthopods of Singapore** <br> What makes a beetle an insect, a spider not? What terrestrial arthopods call Singapore home, and what can we discover about the secret lives of these critters that share our spaces while living vibrant lives completely separate from our own? Join Sean in discovering the answers to some of these questions, and learn about the creepy crawlers you've seen as well as those you haven't, and why they are all important in the ecosystem we are also a part of.

* **Dugongs: The Sirens of Singapore by Sirius Ng**<br> The dugong is a marine mammal that is highly associated to the seagrass habitats of the tropical Indo-Pacific. This shy and elusive species feature in many regional folklores and local rituals but scientific information of Southeast Asian populations is poorly understood. Already ‘Vulnerable to Extinction’ throughout its range, dugong populations are further impacted by marine urbanisation and the consequential loss of suitable habitats. In this talk, our team shares what we understand about the dugong populations within the territorial waters of Singapore and suggest ways we can better aid in saving this species.

* **The Great Diversity of Insects in Singapore by Foo Maosheng** <br> Singapore is known to be a city in nature with many greens spaces, where one is able to see the large diversity of animals and plants that live around us. Among the animals, insect is the largest group of animals with at least 1.1 million species have been described, and there are many more still awaiting to be discovered. Walking through some of our green spaces, such as the nearby parks and nature reserves, one will get to see a number of insects such as butterflies, bees, dragonflies and beetles. However, that's only a tiny fraction of the huge diversity in Singapore, with some are actually hiding in plain sight. In this talk, you will get to see some of the insects that you may not have seen before but have been living among us for the longest time.

* **Dogs in Translation by Candy Lim-Soliano &amp; Liu Xiao Xuan** <br>
Do you find yourself often wondering about how your dog is feeling, what his tail wag means, or if he’s doing zoomies because he’s having a really great time? And what’s with that “guilty look” Fido is giving - did he chew up another pair of shoes? Whether you're a first-time pet guardian or have had the pleasure of living with companion dogs for years, learning to understand what your pet is saying can give you a lot of useful information, such as when they are spooked or anxious about what is going on, or when they are stressed out and may snap at someone. The good news is, our dogs are speaking to us ALL the time! And although you may not “speak dog”, your dog's body language communicates their emotional state and intentions to others around. Join Candy (Kaizen 4 Dogs) and Xuan (Allies of Dogs) at this insightful talk and learn how to interpret your dog’s body language so that you’ll be able to better support your own pet and build a stronger bond with them!
